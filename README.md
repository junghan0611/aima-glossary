# `aima-glossary`

용어 사전

This project is intended to provide [definitions for all the terms](glossary.md) in *Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach*. The definitions will be filled in over time by volunteers--maybe you. We've got a good start, but we need more help.

The file [glossary.md](glossary.md) contains an alphabetic list of terms, some with definitions, in markdown format.

The file [sentences.txt](sentences.txt) contains the LaTeX source of all the sentences in the book that define a term.
